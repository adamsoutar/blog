How do you test your markdown blog compiler?
By writing blog posts to test it with.

The main body of the post is transpiled using
Markdown -> HTML and essentially pasting it
into the document.

You can embed code into them as well, although
it's not syntax highlighted yet.

``` js
const person = {
  name: 'Adam',
  age: 16
}
alert`Hello ${person.name}, you're ${person.age}`
```

There are also `code snippets`
